# Shadow-OpsProject Name: Data Analysis with SQLAlchemy ORM

This project involves analyzing data retrieved from an already cleaned dataset using SQLAlchemy ORM. The data is preprocessed, refined, and leveraged for insightful queries.

Task 1:
1. Column Selection:
   Identify and select a maximum of 20 most relevant columns required for analysis from the dataset obtained in the previous tasks.

2. ORM Implementation (SQLAlchemy):
   Refactor the data handling process to utilize SQLAlchemy ORM for improved data manipulation, query execution, and database interaction.

3. Table Optimization:
●	    Incorporate an index (btree) to enhance data retrieval speed.
●	    Introduce a composite key constraint to ensure uniqueness and data integrity within the table structure.

 Task 2:
1. Query Development:
   Devised a set of at least five queries that delve into the dataset to extract meaningful insights. These queries offer valuable information about the data, such as trends, patterns, correlations, and relevant statistics.

 Usage:
1. Installation:
   Use Poetry to manage dependencies and ensure the required packages are installed.

2. Execution:
   - Implement the provided scripts to perform data preprocessing, ORM setup, and query execution.
   - Ensure the necessary configurations are in place to run the code successfully.

3. Customization:
   - Adjust the number of columns selected for analysis based on specific requirements.
   - Modify and expand the set of queries as needed to derive more profound insights from the dataset.
